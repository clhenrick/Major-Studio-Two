Web Audio API Test
==================

### Some code was reused from the following: 

*  Chris Wilson's [Pitch Detector](https://github.com/cwilso/PitchDetect)
*  The [Web Audio API book](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552) by O'Reilly written by Boris Smus
*  The [HTML5 Rocks tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/) also written by Boris Smus.

## Project Goals:

1. To successfully take input from the user's computer's built in microphone and send it to the browser using the Web Audio API
2. Visualize it! 
3. Potential prototype for visualizing sound from an analog drumset.

## Precendence:
